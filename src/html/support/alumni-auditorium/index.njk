            <h2>Alumni Auditorium Seats</h2>

            <p>We continue to sell seat adoptions for $100 each. We provided funds for the renovation of the room a few years ago and will be making other contributions soon for additional upgrades. About 30% of the seats have been adopted to date. We have placed tags on the back of each seat that was adopted listing the name of the donor/donors and the person/persons the seat was adopted to honor or remember. Seats have been adopted for loved ones, teachers, administrators, parents and coaches. Consider adopting a seat today with your tax-deductible gift. Please send a check today to:</p>
